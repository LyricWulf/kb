This bot handles all tickets that can be sent by users simply by DM'ing the bot directly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Only one mod should be handling each case unless it has been explicitly assigned to another mod.**

## Responding to tickets

A channel will be created with the user's name and discord discriminator under the tickets category when they send the report in. Simply use the text chat to reply to the ticket directly and the bot will send the user all messages sent in that chat.

_Note: any message in the channel that has "=" before it will not be sent to the user; however, we ask that all discussions of the tickets in the appropriate channels._

## Closing tickets

While in the ticket chat, type `=close <reason>` and the bot will delete the channel, as well as log the whole chat, and send the closing reason to the user's direct messages.
