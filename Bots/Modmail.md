This bot handles all tickets that can be sent by users simply by DM'ing the bot directly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Only one moderate should be handling each case unless it has been passed by the original mod to another person.**

## Responding to tickets

A channel will be create with the user's name and discord discriminator under the tickets category when they send the report in. Simply use the text chat to reply to the ticket directly and the bot will send the user all messages sent in that chat.

_Note that and message in the channel that has "=" before it will not be sent to the user; however, we ask that you do all discussions of the tickets in the appropriate channels_

## Closing tickets

While in the ticket chat, type `=close <reason>` and the bot will delete the channel, as well as log the whole chat, and send the closing reason to the user's direct messages.
