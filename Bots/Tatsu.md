Tatausmaki is the bot used for the star roles within the server.

This bot mostly just responds to users with the "admin" permission; however, knowing how this commands work is better in case you have that permission at some point and have to use these commands.

## Useful Commands

- `blacklist` disables command for that channel.

- `whitelist` is an invert command of `blacklist` and has to be toggled in order for it work within the server.

- `scores` allows for adding/subtracting of server exp that grants users access to the "star roles". [![Transfer rank](https://img.shields.io/badge/Transfer_Rank-informational?logo=lastpass)](/Roles/Beta/Actions/TransferRank.md)
