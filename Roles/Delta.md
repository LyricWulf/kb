# ‚óÜ ‚ù± Roles ‚ù± Delta

The role of Deltas will be to engage with the community as their main focal point while still moderating lightly. The users with this role are expected to be friendly and active members that can add to the conversations in the chats and try to get all members of the server to engage with each other.

They will not be focusing on moderation tasks, but instead on helping the server, the community, prosper as a friendly environment. The little area of moderation that they cover is mostly being overseers of the chat and reporting to the rest of the team (Betas) if the situations happen to get out of hand.

## üí¨ Chat

Your primary task as a Delta is to engage with the community, spark conversation, and direct conversation in a positive direction. You are the face of the Pack Leaders, and are expected to present yourself as friendly and approachable.

You are expected to answer any questions asked about the server, be it from a new member who is trying to learn about the server, or a member that is asking about a server change. If you don't know the answer, please find out or ping someone who can help.

## ‚ùó Reporting an issue

If a member wants to report an issue, please direct them to the Ticket bot. Both members and Pack Leaders are encouraged to use this bot to communicate with the team.

Before reporting an issue, you should try to verbally handle the issue. That includes politely asking a user to stop something, or by addressing and de-escalating a situation.

If necessary, you may mute or isolate a user before proceeding. If the issue persists, you will need to submit a ticket to report the issue.

If submitting a ticket is necessary report the issue by DMing the ticketing bot with a description of the issue and the IDs of any relevant users. You can also send images and they will be included in the report. Please include screenshots whenever possible.

## üìÖ Event Management

Community Managers are expected to at least try to host events from time to time. #event-planning can be used for the Deltas to discuss upcoming events and plan out who is hosting the event and what the event is. Events can range from game lobbies--SFW games only--to giveaways/art contests. #events is where you can post the giveaway/polls for next events and for role pinging @events.
