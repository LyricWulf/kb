## Procedure

When a user is banned, they're sent the ban appeal [link](https://lyri.city/appeal), and are free to appeal at any time. The Alphas will evaluate the appeal and determine whether or not the user should be allowed back into the community. The Alphas might ask the Betas for their thoughts. Once an appeal is submitted, the Alphas will go over it the next time there is a meeting, or someone decides to open the document. We do not have a regularly scheduled ban appeal meeting. We will not always tell a user if we have gone over their appeal, usually it will be if we have decided to let them back into the community. If they're not messaged, their appeal was probably rejected. 

### The Following are reasons that result in permanent bans:

- Raiding/Trolling
- Distributing pornography in the server or DMs
- Any sexual interactions with an underage member of the server in public or in private.
