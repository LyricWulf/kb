# [◆](/) ❱ [Roles](/Roles) ❱ [Beta](/Roles/Beta) ❱ Role Explanation: Beta

The role of Betas will be to moderate the community and watch over the Deltas. They do not have a hand in picking Deltas, but they are expected to communicate with each other in what they can do to help grow the server. They are in-charge of handling the Delta reviews and are expected to still engage with the members of the server; however, they have a stronger focus on moderating the server knowing when and how to enforce the rules.

## Warnings

### **Warnings** for Mischievous Content

When there is content that is found to be out of line, we should remove the content and message the posting member with a friendly reminder of the rules. This is what we call a verbal warning (not to be confused with a bot warn, which would go on the permanent server record). To avoid piling up on people, always be sure to report back to the mod chat when you delete content or DM a member regarding rules or other mod business.

Conveying the purpose of a rule is one of the most important skills of a Pack Leader. When we give out warnings, we want to not only say the rule but also be able to have the member understand how the rule makes the server a better place. Overall, just talking to them as a friend has proven to be the best approach to warnings.

### **Warns** for Severe Behavior

Sometimes, a member might exhibit malicious behaviors such as repeatedly breaking a rule that they have already been reminded of, or breaching any of our zero tolerance rules. Our general policy is that we will try to give leeway whenever possible, but if a member has a pattern of bad behavior, we will take more drastic measures and log a warn in the server records. These records are stored in a bot and can lead to moderation action taken on the member.

1 warnings: warning & mute 2 warnings: strict warning 3 warnings: Final warn and longer mute (8 hours or so on) Any warnings after third result in a permanent ban

## Avoiding Moderation

When members are given a mute role, they can leave the server and rejoin in order to get rid of the Muted role. This is what we consider avoiding moderation, and will be logged as a warn.
