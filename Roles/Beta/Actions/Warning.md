# [◆](/) ❱ [Roles](/Roles) ❱ [Beta](/Roles/Beta) ❱ [Actions](/Roles/Beta/Actions) ❱ Warning

## Procedure

If the user posted an image or link in the wrong chat, then a Pack Leader should simply mention the user in that same chat and remind them not to do that again.

If a server rule has been broken, then the user in question should be DM'd by a **Beta** about the situation and warned. The whole DM warn should be screenshotted and posted in #Beta-reports. After it has been recorded in the reports channel, proceed with using the warn command to log it within the modlog channel.

## Command

`/warn ID -r <insert reason here>`
