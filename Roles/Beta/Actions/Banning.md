## Conditions

For NSFW/NSFL Media/Topics please refer to [![NSFW/NSFL Media/Topics](https://img.shields.io/badge/NSFW\/NSFL_Media\/Topics-informational?logo=lastpass)](/Infractions/InappropriateMedia.md)

Banning members is done on a case-by-case basis. There is no specific criteria for a ban to occur. The Betas discuss it in #beta-chat as if they need to be banned, or just warned, etc.

## Procedure

The matter is to be discussed in the #Beta-chat among all the Betas. 

If the user joins and immedietly trolls the server (up to Beta discression), they don't require a DM as their intention was clear. 

If the user being banned is a member of the community, and is being banned for repetitive misconduct, they are to be DM'd by a Beta with the reason. **This message should not be done in a rude or incriminating way. We are to treat this in a way that we're not punishing the user, but having to treat this situation fairly.** The user is to be sent the ban appeal [link](https://lyri.city/appeal) .  

## Command

`/ban ID -r <insert reason here.`

Or you can right click (tap and hold on mobile) on the users name/profile picture, and ban them through Discord. Afterwards, you can go to `#beta-commands` and use the `/reason` command.
