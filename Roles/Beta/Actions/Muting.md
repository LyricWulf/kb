# [◆](/) ❱ [Roles](/Roles) ❱ [Beta](/Roles/Beta) ❱ [Actions](/Roles/Beta/Actions) ❱ Muting

## Conditions

User is being troublesome in the chat by either harassing users or not stopping when asked.

## Procedure

Try to dispel the current problem peacefully; however, if the user refuses or continues the problem after being told to stop, then you may mute them to your one discretion as long as the reason given backs it up.

**If a user is doing something to get muted, they also get a warning in blarg with the same reason for the mute.**

## Command

`/mute ID -r <put your reason for the mute, here> -t 2hr` This will mute the user for 2 hours and put the reason in the bot log. 
`/warn ID -r <copy of the reason for the mute>`
