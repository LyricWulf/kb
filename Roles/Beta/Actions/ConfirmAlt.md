# [◆](/) ❱ [Roles](/Roles) ❱ [Beta](/Roles/Beta) ❱ [Actions](/Roles/Beta/Actions) ❱ Confirming an Alt

There are several instances in which we may want to confirm an Alt. In the event of a User creating an Alt, we may have to assist in kicking the Member or transferring rank, however, we must first verify that the Alt belongs to the User.

## Verification

Please assert one of the following (rated by confidence):

**1.** User and Alt **both confirm**.

**2.** Alt has **Connected accounts** matching User.

**3.** User has **no activity for at least a week**, with Alt picking up where activity left off.
