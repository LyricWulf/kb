# [◆](/) ❱ [Roles](/Roles) ❱ [Beta](/Roles/Beta) ❱ [Actions](/Roles/Beta/Actions) ❱ Isolation

## Conditions

User is being troublesome in the chat by either harassing users or not stopping when asked.

User have [NSFW/NSFL](/Infractions/InappropriateMedia.md) pfp/name.

User talk using [NSFW](/Infractions/InappropriateMedia.md) words, and won't stop after being asked to.

User talking with negative thoughts (Suicide; other very deperessive topics), and won't stop after being asked not discuss that publically.

## Procedure

Navigate to `#isolation`, `#pl-commands`, or `#beta-commands` and use the `/iso` command to isolate the user. 

**Please note that when a user is brought into isolation, they will not be able to see any message sent before they click on the channel. if you Isolate the user and then immedietly talk to them, they might ask "Why am i here, what is going on". This is because they literally can't see your first message. Please copy and paste it so they can see why they're there.**

**Please try to have your first message ping the user, and ask them to change the thing that needs to be changed, with your first message. That way they know straight away what's going on and won't be too confused.**

From there, discuss with the user of what needs to change, be it their profile picture, nickname, username, or behavior. The goal would be to do so without threatening or otherwise incriminating the user. We do not want to hold our "power" over the user to get them to stop the thing, we want to request they change it as it's required due to server rules. 

Should the user not cooperate, or refuse to change the required thing, the Beta may discuss this with other Betas about banning the user, or to wait and see if they will change their mind over a short time (usually 1-2 days if they're a new user). 

## Command

`/iso ID` Command can be used in `#introductions`, as well as `#pl-commands`, `#beta-commands`, and `#isolation`.
