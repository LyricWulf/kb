# [◆](/../../) ❱ [Infractions](/Infractions) ❱ Raids

## Procedure

Betas are allowed to ban involved users during a raid at their discretion and without warning.

- If the raid consist of more than 10 users, then the **Betas or Deltas** have permission to disable the `send messages` permission in the server's `@everyone` role. In this case, Alpha should be pinged instantly and repeatedly so that they can launch the bot for raids and ban the raiders. Until then, **Betas** can start to ban the users one by one.
