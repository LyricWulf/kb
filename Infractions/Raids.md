# [◆](/) ❱ [Infractions](/Infractions) ❱ Raids

## Procedure

Betas should ban involved users during a raid¹ at their discretion and without warning².

- If the raid consists of more than 20 users, then the **Betas or Deltas** have permission to disable the `send messages` permission in the server's `@everyone` role. In this case, Alpha should be pinged *immediately* so that they can handle the situation. Until then, **Betas** should start to ban the users one by one.

¹_if the group consists of less than 3 users then it is unlikely to be considered a raid._

²_You still must have reasoning behind your bans to justify them_ <!-- TAGS --> <!-- Raid -->
