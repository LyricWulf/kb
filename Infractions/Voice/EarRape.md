This page refers to **Ear Rape in voice channels**.

In a voice channel, the following are considered Ear Rape:

- "Spiking" mic, harmful audio, or otherwise excessive distortion (or intent thereof)
- Producing audio that violates any of the server's content rules.
- Producing otherwise unwanted audio, **and not stopping when asked.**

## Handling Ear Rape

### An Ear Rape was reported

- If **proof was provided**, Voice Mute the Member.

- If **proof was not provided**, we cannot establish fault. Contact the Member and, in a **non-incriminating** way, remind them that Ear Rape is against the server rules.

  - NOTE: If there are _multiple_ reports for the same Member, this can be used in place of proof by discretion.

### If you were in the voice chat

Voice Mute the Member.

### Beta Action

- [Beta](/Roles/Beta) should be DMing the user and logging a warn in Blarg. Should the user understand this is not acceptable, the voice mute can be lifted. If this happens again, they should be given the `Voice Muted` role, and warned. 

  - If the user is not understanding and begins to argue, they should just be given the `Voice Muted` role.
