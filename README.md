# Pack Leaders

Welcome to the Pack Leaders! Our primary role is to promote interaction, encourage member involvement, and build a sense of community within Lyricity. We should be adding value to the server by posting positive and engaging content and setting a shining example for other members. We should be helping out members with their queries and we should be keeping chats alive by asking questions and engaging with everyone who wants to chat.

# Using the Knowledge Base

We are currently building a comprehensive Knowledge Base (KB) for Pack Leaders. Please stand by while we are setting this up. 💝
