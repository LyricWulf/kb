# [◆](/../../) ❱ [Voice](/Voice) ❱ Inappropriate Behavior

This page refers to **Inappropriate Behavior/Topics in voice channels**.

In a voice channel, the following are considered Inappropriate Behavior/Topics:

- Disturbing conversations
- Heated Political debates
- Refusing to mute in practice room while others are performing
- Producing otherwise unwanted audio, **and not stopping when asked.**

## Procedure

### An Inappropriate Behavior was reported

- If **proof was provided**, Voice Mute the Member.

- If **proof was not provided**, we cannot establish fault. Contact the Member and, in a **non-incriminating** way, remind them that what was reported is against the server rules.

  - NOTE: If there are _multiple_ reports for the same Member, this can be used in place of proof by discretion.

### If you were in the voice chat

Voice Mute the Member.
