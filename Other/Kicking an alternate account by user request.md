# Kicking an alternate account by user request

There are many cases in which a user may want another account removed, for example, if they were hacked and do not have access to the account anymore.

## 1\. Verification

Before proceeding, we need to verify that [Old Account (OA) belongs to New Account (NA)][verify].

Please assert one of the following:

```
NA has Connected accounts matching OA.
OA ceases activity for several days with NA picking up where activity left off.
```

## 2\. Procedure

After verifying the prerequisites,

```
If applicable, before kicking OA, ask an Alpha to transfer rank from OA to NA
by giving them the respective UIDs.
Submit a kick command and include in the reason NA's UID.
```
