# Kicking an alternate account by user request

There are many cases in which a user may want another account removed, for example, if they were hacked and do not have access to the account anymore. Verification

Before proceeding, we need to confirm that Old Account (OA) belongs to New Account (NA).

Please assert one of the following:

```
NA has Connected accounts matching OA.
OA ceases activity for several days with NA picking up where activity left off.
```

Procedure

After verifying the prerequisites,

```
If applicable, before kicking OA, ask an Alpha to transfer rank from OA to NA
by giving them the respective UIDs.
Submit a kick command and include in the reason NA's UID.
```
