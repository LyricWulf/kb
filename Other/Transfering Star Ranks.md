# Adding or transferring rank

You may want to add rank to a User or transfer rank from one User to another. Rank transfers are done upon request to an Alpha.

If you are transferring rank from an Account that is pending kick, please do not kick the Account until the rank transfer is complete. Adding rank

At the time, we will not add rank without transferring from another User. Transferring rank Prerequisites

Before proceeding, we need to confirm that Old Account (OA) belongs to New Account (NA).

Please assert one of the following:

```
NA has Connected accounts matching OA.
OA ceases activity for several days with NA picking up where activity left off.
```

## Procedure

After verifying a User's New Account, please provide an Alpha with the following information:

```
Old Account UID
New Account UID
```

Given this information, Alphas will be able to transfer rank from OA to NA.

Note: If OA has been kicked, Alphas can still retrieve the rank data, but it may take longer.
