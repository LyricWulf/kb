[![Confirm alt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires-Confirm_Alt-red)](/Other/ConfirmAlt.md)

There are many cases in which a user may want another account removed, for example, if they were hacked and do not have access to the account anymore.

## Procedure

After verifying the prerequisites,

1. If applicable, before kicking the User, ask an Alpha to transfer rank from the User to the Alt by giving them the respective UIDs. [![Transfer rank](https://img.shields.io/badge/kb-Transfer_Rank-blue)](/Other/TransferRank.md)

2. Submit a kick command for the User and in the reason include the Alt ID.
